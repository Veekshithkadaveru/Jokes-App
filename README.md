This repository hosts the code for my personal project, the Jokes App.

It incorporates the following well-known libraries:

Hilt: A dependency injection library designed for Android, simplifying the setup of manual dependency injection in the project.

Room: A persistence library that offers an abstraction layer over SQLite, making it easier to interact with the database while leveraging SQLiteâ€™s capabilities.

Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for both Android and the JVM.

Moshi: A contemporary JSON library tailored for Kotlin and Java.
