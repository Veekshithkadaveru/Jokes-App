# Jokes
This repository contains the code for Jokes App which is my personal project.

It includes the following popular libraries:

- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.

- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and the JVM.

- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.

  ## USP 
  - Caching Support
  - UI build on Jetpack Compose
  

## Annotation Processing

This project uses [Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html) for annotation processing, which provides faster build times compared to [KAPT]
